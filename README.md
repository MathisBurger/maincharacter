# Maincharacter

This project is kind of a joke. I built this for me and my friends for our private
discord server. But if you want to use it, feel free to do so, its open for everybody.
Therefore, this README is not as detailed as it should be.

## Techstack

This application uses discordgo for the interaction with the discord API
